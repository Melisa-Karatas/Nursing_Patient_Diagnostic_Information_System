# Nursing_Patient_Diagnostic_Information_System
 In this simple python project with database, I tried to make a patient diagnostic information system using SQL.

#### ❗️ I will be updating this project in time since it is still ongoing.
_____
As a nursing intern student, every day we have to gather those informations from all the patients we are responsible for. So to make it easier to store the data, in this project I created two classes: one for patients and the other for vital signs.
* In class 'Hasta' you can save the personal and clinic info you gathered from the patient.
* In class 'Anta' you can save the vital signs of the patient. Anta is an abbreviation for all the elements you should be checking for vitals in my mother language.

## Operations You Can Do In This System
   * You can add, update or remove a patient.

  * You can see the list of the patients and all the vital sign informations.
  * You can look for a patient by entering their personal id number.
